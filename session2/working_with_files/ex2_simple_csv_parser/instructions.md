Stage 1:<br>
Write a function that turns each line to a dictionary ( keys are described in the first row ), and print it.<br>

Stage 2:<br>
Edit the function from Stage 1 - this time convert the timestamps to human readable dates.<br>

Stage 3:<br>
Write a function that returns an array of those dictionaries from stage 2.<br>

Stage 4:<br>
Write the results from stage 3 to a new file named: daily_events_dist.txt,<br>
each dictionary in a new line<br>
